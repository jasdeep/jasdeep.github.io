Welcome! My name is Jasdeep Singh. I am a software engineer, a translator, and an
aspiring researcher of humanities and social sciences.

Corporation](<http://www.basware.com/>)'s Chandigarh office on the Research and
Development Team, where I work among a group of leading software engineers and
architects on the our core e Invoicing system.

I have also worked as translator/additional dialogue writer for three award
winning Punjabi films. I curate [a blog on translated Punjabi

and films in some academic conferences.
